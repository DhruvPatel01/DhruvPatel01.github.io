Luckily, we computer engineers do not have to deal with different units. All our units are power of 2. We have sensible names, Kilo, Mega, Giga, you get it. When we get unlucky, there could be a confusion of whether Kilo in the context is $ 2^{10} $ or $ 10^3 $. But that is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in other engineering (and science) branches this is not the case. A while ago I was taking a course &amp;ldquo;Introduction Aeronautical Engineering&amp;rdquo; on edX (the course is from TUDelft). Honestly, the homework problems there were annoying, at least for me. I can understand that students in the Aero department might need to practice the conversion process.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
