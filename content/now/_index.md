Last week I started learning to swim. Just today I finished "Godel's Proof" by Nagel and Newman. It was a wonderful book. However, such a short book did not go deeper in the topic. I am glad though, as my understanding of logic is not that good. 
I also started reading "The Seasoned Schemer", and "Designing Data Intensive Applications". I am planning to take DDIA slowly and target to finish it in 6 months. 
- In progress: 
  - Crafting Interpreters (at chapter 29 now). Looks like will be done by next update of this page. However, I plan to reread it for the virtual machine part, while implementing it in Rust at the same time. 


However I did not make any progress on following things. I don't think I will resume them in upcoming couple of months. 
  - Special Relativity
  - Spark

Finally, I have finished the Programming for High Performance course. I'd started is about a year back. But had stopped when WFO started, and I had to shift back to Bangalore. But, finally finished it. Great course. 

Apart from that, I am continuing reading following things.
- Crafting Interpreters (at chapter 24 right now) (looking at Github, I had started reading the book around October 2022).
- Special Relativity (Susskind)

Started new
- Godel's Proof, by Ernest and Nagel.
- Spark

This week, I finished up reading `The Little Schemer`. The book started out easy. But, the second-to-last chapter made me aware of the applicative order Y Combinator. It also showed halting problem with a different lens. The book pointed to other interesting books at the end.
- Godel's proof
- to mock the mockingbird

I think I'll read Godel's proof before I start the seasoned schemer. 

Apart from that, I am also following a great course on [Programming for High Performance computing](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/laff/pfhp/). I am currently at the third week. I'll try to complete the course hopefully this month.

I am also focusing more on Special Relativity ([Susskind's course and book](https://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/special-relativity-and-electrodynamics/2012/spring)) this month relative to other months, as I am at home (Patan), where I get more time. Though, I am home for few days only, so pace will slow down after a week or so.
