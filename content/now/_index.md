I have revised my TAoCP target to 1.6 pages per day, as I found it hard to find time for it. So far the progress is good enough.  I also started reading [Understanding Deep Learning by Simon Prince](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/). I am currently on Chapter 4. Although, I have close to 6 years of experience working with Deep Networks, I find this book really intreseting, and found many things that I was not aware of earlier.

In the board game side, we learned Ticket to Ride, some expansions of Carcassone, Lost Cities, and Jaipur. Castles of Burgandy is still in my list to learn. I added Terraforming Mars in to the to learn list as well. 

I am planning to start a personal project, probably in Rust. I have outlined what I want outof it. Hoping to get some time to work on it this month.

Just got married in December. We rented a new house, set it up, bought some furniture. So haven't had time to update this page much. But, I think most of the stuff is done, so will have more time.

I have started reading "The Art of Computer Programming Vol 1" by Donald Knuth. I plan to read about 2 pages on average, and the target is to finish the volume 1 by the end of the year. 

Apart from that, I have started playing board games with my wife. Currently, we play Carcasonne a lot. Though, I am learning other 2 Player games (Castles of Burgandy, 7 Wonders Duel, and Pax Renaissance), which will probably take my remaining time away. Hence, not readling or learning anything else.
