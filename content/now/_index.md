This week, I finished up reading `The Little Schemer`. The book started out easy. But, the second-to-last chapter made me aware of the applicative order Y Combinator. It also showed halting problem with a different lens. The book pointed to other interesting books at the end.
- Godel's proof
- to mock the mockingbird

I think I'll read Godel's proof before I start the seasoned schemer. 

Apart from that, I am also following a great course on [Programming for High Performance computing](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/laff/pfhp/). I am currently at the third week. I'll try to complete the course hopefully this month.

I am also focusing more on Special Relativity ([Susskind's course and book](https://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/special-relativity-and-electrodynamics/2012/spring)) this month relative to other months, as I am at home (Patan), where I get more time. Though, I am home for few days only, so pace will slow down after a week or so.
