Just got married in December. We rented a new house, set it up, bought some furniture. So haven't had time to update this page much. But, I think most of the stuff is done, so will have more time.

I have started reading "The Art of Computer Programming Vol 1" by Donald Knuth. I plan to read about 2 pages on average, and the target is to finish the volume 1 by the end of the year. 

Apart from that, I have started playing board games with my wife. Currently, we play Carcasonne a lot. Though, I am learning other 2 Player games (Castles of Burgandy, 7 Wonders Duel, and Pax Renaissance), which will probably take my remaining time away. Hence, not readling or learning anything else.
