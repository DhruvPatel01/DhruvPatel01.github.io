Hi, I am Dhruv. As a Senior Machine Leraning Engineer at [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com). Previously I worked at [Myntra](https://www.myntra.com) on personalised size recommendation models. I graduated from the department of Computer Science and Automation at Indian Institute of Science in 2019. There I worked mostly on image segmentation problem and little bit on using machine learning on graph like structures.

You can reach out to me at `hello at domain`.
