Hi, I am Dhruv. As a Data Scientist at [Myntra](https://www.myntra.com), I work on personalised size recommendation models. I graduated from the department of Computer Science and Automation at Indian Institute of Science in 2019. There I worked mostly on image segmentation problem and little bit on using machine learning on graph like structures.

You can reach out to me at `hello at domain`.
