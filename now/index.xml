&lt;p>Last week I started learning to swim. Just today I finished &amp;ldquo;Godel&amp;rsquo;s Proof&amp;rdquo; by Nagel and Newman. It was a wonderful book. However, such a short book did not go deeper in the topic. I am glad though, as my understanding of logic is not that good.
I also started reading &amp;ldquo;The Seasoned Schemer&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Designing Data Intensive Applications&amp;rdquo;. I am planning to take DDIA slowly and target to finish it in 6 months.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
