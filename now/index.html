Updated: 6th April, 2024
I have revised my TAoCP target to 1.6 pages per day, as I found it hard to find time for it. So far the progress is good enough. I also started reading Understanding Deep Learning by Simon Prince. I am currently on Chapter 4. Although, I have close to 6 years of experience working with Deep Networks, I find this book really intreseting, and found many things that I was not aware of earlier.

Castles of Burgandy is still in my list to learn. I added Terraforming Mars in to the to learn list as well.</p><p>I am planning to start a personal project, probably in Rust.

We rented a new house, set it up, bought some furniture. So haven&rsquo;t had time to update this page much. But, I think most of the stuff is done, so will have more time.</p><p>I have started reading &ldquo;The Art of Computer Programming Vol 1&rdquo; by Donald Knuth. I plan to read about 2 pages on average, and the target is to finish the volume 1 by the end of the year.</p><p>Apart from that, I have started playing board games with my wife. Currently, we play Carcasonne a lot. Though, I am learning other 2 Player games (Castles of Burgandy, 7 Wonders Duel, and Pax Renaissance), which will probably take my remaining time away. Hence, not readling or learning anything else.</p><hr></div><div class=posts><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://dhruvpatel.dev/now/archive/>What I was doing earlier?</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2024-03-08</span></div><div class=post-content><p><small>(This is an archival of my <a href=https://nownownow.com/about>now page</a>.)</small></p><p><small>Updated: 23rd May 2023</small></p><p>Last week I started learning to swim. Just today I finished &ldquo;Godel&rsquo;s Proof&rdquo; by Nagel and Newman. It was a wonderful book. However, such a short book did not go deeper in the topic. I am glad though, as my understanding of logic is not that good.
I also started reading &ldquo;The Seasoned Schemer&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Designing Data Intensive Applications&rdquo;. I am planning to take DDIA slowly and target to finish it in 6 months.</p></div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/now/archive/>→</a></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class="copyright copyright--user"><span>Dhruv Patel</span>
