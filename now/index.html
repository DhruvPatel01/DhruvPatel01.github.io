Last week I started learning to swim. Just today I finished &amp;ldquo;Godel&amp;rsquo;s Proof&amp;rdquo; by Nagel and Newman. It was a wonderful book. However, such a short book did not go deeper in the topic. I am glad though, as my understanding of logic is not that good. I also started reading &amp;ldquo;The Seasoned Schemer&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Designing Data Intensive Applications&amp;rdquo;. I am planning to take DDIA slowly and target to finish it in 6 months."><meta name=keywords content><meta name=robots content="noodp"><link rel=canonical href=https://dhruvpatel.dev/now/><link rel=stylesheet href=https://dhruvpatel.dev/assets/style.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://dhruvpatel.dev/img/apple-touch-icon-192x192.png><link rel="shortcut icon" href=https://dhruvpatel.dev/img/favicon/orange.png><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta property="og:locale" content="en"><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:title" content="What am I doing Now?"><meta property="og:description" content="(This is a now page.)

However, I plan to reread it for the virtual machine part, while implementing it in Rust at the same time.</li></ul></li></ul><p>However I did not make any progress on following things. I don&rsquo;t think I will resume them in upcoming couple of months.</p><ul><li>Special Relativity</li><li>Spark</li></ul><hr><p><small>Updated: 3rd April 2023</small>
Finally, I have finished the Programming for High Performance course. I&rsquo;d started is about a year back. But had stopped when WFO started, and I had to shift back to Bangalore. But, finally finished it. Great course.</p><p>Apart from that, I am continuing reading following things.</p><ul><li>Crafting Interpreters (at chapter 24 right now) (looking at Github, I had started reading the book around October 2022).</li><li>Special Relativity (Susskind)</li></ul><p>Started new</p><ul><li>Godel&rsquo;s Proof, by Ernest and Nagel.</li><li>Spark</li></ul><p><small>Updated: 6th March 2023</small></p><p>This week, I finished up reading <code>The Little Schemer</code>. The book started out easy. But, the second-to-last chapter made me aware of the applicative order Y Combinator. It also showed halting problem with a different lens. The book pointed to other interesting books at the end.</p><ul><li>Godel&rsquo;s proof</li><li>to mock the mockingbird</li></ul><p>I think I&rsquo;ll read Godel&rsquo;s proof before I start the seasoned schemer.</p><p>Apart from that, I am also following a great course on <a href=https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/laff/pfhp/>Programming for High Performance computing</a>. I am currently at the third week. I&rsquo;ll try to complete the course hopefully this month.</p><p>I am also focusing more on Special Relativity (<a href=https://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/special-relativity-and-electrodynamics/2012/spring>Susskind&rsquo;s course and book</a>) this month relative to other months, as I am at home (Patan), where I get more time. Though, I am home for few days only, so pace will slow down after a week or so.</p></div><div class=posts><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class="copyright copyright--user"><span>Dhruv Patel</span>
