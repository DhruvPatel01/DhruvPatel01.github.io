Updated: 6th April, 2024 I have revised my TAoCP target to 1.6 pages per day, as I found it hard to find time for it. So far the progress is good enough. I also started reading Understanding Deep Learning by Simon Prince. I am currently on Chapter 4. Although, I have close to 6 years of experience working with Deep Networks, I find this book really intreseting, and found many things that I was not aware of earlier."><meta name=keywords content><meta name=robots content="noodp"><link rel=canonical href=https://dhruvpatel.dev/now/><link rel=stylesheet href=https://dhruvpatel.dev/assets/style.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://dhruvpatel.dev/img/apple-touch-icon-192x192.png><link rel="shortcut icon" href=https://dhruvpatel.dev/img/favicon/orange.png><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta property="og:locale" content="en"><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:title" content="What am I doing Now?"><meta property="og:description" content="(This is a now page.)

I have revised my TAoCP target to 1.6 pages per day, as I found it hard to find time for it. So far the progress is good enough. I also started reading <a href=https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/>Understanding Deep Learning by Simon Prince</a>. I am currently on Chapter 4. Although, I have close to 6 years of experience working with Deep Networks, I find this book really intreseting, and found many things that I was not aware of earlier.</p><p>In the board game side, we learned Ticket to Ride, some expansions of Carcassone, Lost Cities, and Jaipur. Castles of Burgandy is still in my list to learn. I added Terraforming Mars in to the to learn list as well.</p><p>I am planning to start a personal project, probably in Rust. I have outlined what I want outof it. Hoping to get some time to work on it this month.</p><p><small>Updated: 8th March, 2024</small></p><p>Just got married in December. We rented a new house, set it up, bought some furniture. So haven&rsquo;t had time to update this page much. But, I think most of the stuff is done, so will have more time.</p><p>I have started reading &ldquo;The Art of Computer Programming Vol 1&rdquo; by Donald Knuth. I plan to read about 2 pages on average, and the target is to finish the volume 1 by the end of the year.</p><p>Apart from that, I have started playing board games with my wife. Currently, we play Carcasonne a lot. Though, I am learning other 2 Player games (Castles of Burgandy, 7 Wonders Duel, and Pax Renaissance), which will probably take my remaining time away. Hence, not readling or learning anything else.</p><hr></div><div class=posts><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://dhruvpatel.dev/now/archive/>What I was doing earlier?</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2024-03-08</span></div><div class=post-content>(This is an archival of my now page.)
Updated: 23rd May 2023
Last week I started learning to swim. Just today I finished “Godel’s Proof” by Nagel and Newman. It was a wonderful book. However, such a short book did not go deeper in the topic. I am glad though, as my understanding of logic is not that good. I also started reading “The Seasoned Schemer”, and “Designing Data Intensive Applications”.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/now/archive/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class="copyright copyright--user"><span>Dhruv Patel</span>
