&lt;dt>Interior Point $x \in C$&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>A point is an interior point if we can find &lt;strong>a&lt;/strong> ball around x which is completely inside C.&lt;/dd>
&lt;dt>Open Set&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>A set is open, if all points are interior points.&lt;/dd>
&lt;dt>Closed Set&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>A set is closed, if its complement is open.&lt;/dd>
&lt;dt>Closure&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>Take the set&amp;rsquo;s complement. Find its interior. Take the complement of it. You got a closure.&lt;/dd>
&lt;dd>
&lt;p>A point is in a closure, if for &lt;strong>every&lt;/strong> $\epsilon$, you can find a point from the original set within $\epsilon$ distance.&lt;/p>
&lt;/dd>
&lt;dt>Boundary&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>take the closure and remove the interior.&lt;/dd>
&lt;/dl>
&lt;h2 id="examples">Examples&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For example, closure of (-1, 1) in real line is given by complement of the interior of the (-inf, 1] U [1, inf). Which is the complement of (-inf, 1) U (1, inf), which is [-1, 1].&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
