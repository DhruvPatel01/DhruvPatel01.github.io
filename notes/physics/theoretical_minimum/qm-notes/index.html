And $\sigma_y = \pm 1$, can be denoted by $\ket{o}$ and -1 as $\ket{i}$.</p><p>If two states are orthogonal than these two states can be determined together. For example, if $\sigma_z$ was prepared to be in $\ket{u}$, for any subsequent measurements probability that $\ket{d}$ is detected is 0. Thus for binary spin, the state space is two dimensional. For now we can take $\ket{u}, \ket{d}$ as the basis vectors.</p><p>Then, the generic state $\ket{A} = \alpha_u \ket{u} + \alpha_d \ket{d}$.

It is equivalent to saying that $\ket{A}$ is normalized, i.e. $\braket{A|A} = 1$.</p><p>General principle of quantum systems: the state of a system is represented by a unit (normalized) vector in a vector space of states. Moreover, the squared magnitudes of the components of the state-vector, <strong>along particular basis vectors</strong>, represent probabilities for various experimental outcomes.</p><h3 id=representing-ketr-and-ketl-using-above-basis-vectors>Representing $\ket{r}$ and $\ket{l}$ using above basis vectors<a href=#representing-ketr-and-ketl-using-above-basis-vectors class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>We know that if A initially prepares the state in $\ket{r}$, $\sigma_z = \pm 1$ with equal probability. Hence, $\alpha_u^\ast \alpha_u =\alpha_d^\ast \alpha_d = \frac{1}{2}$. One choice is to have $\alpha_u = \alpha_d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.</p><p>$\ket{r} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{u} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{d}$. (There are is still ambiguity, called phase ambiguity.)</p><p>To solve for $\ket{l}$ the above process repeats. But, in addition, $\braket{l|r} = 0$. One choice is $[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$. But it is not the only choice. Even for fixed choice for $\ket{r}$, you can multiply above choice by a phase factor ($z = e^{i\theta}$), and still satisfy the two constraints. Later, we will find out that no measurable quantity is sensitive to the overall phase-factor, and therefore we can ignore it when specifying states.</p><h3 id=representing-keti-and-keto-using-above-basis-vectors>Representing $\ket{i}$ and $\ket{o}$ using above basis vectors<a href=#representing-keti-and-keto-using-above-basis-vectors class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>To solve for $\ket{i}$ and $\ket{o}$, we need same conditions as we needed above. But we also need additional constrains. For example, if A prepares the state in $\ket{i}$,$\sigma_x = \pm1$, with equal probability. Also $\braket{i|o} = 0$.</p><p>The following solution solves for these constraints (up to phase-factor ambiguity).</p><p>$\ket{i} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{u} + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{d}$.</p><p>$\ket{o} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{u} - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{d}$.</p><p>With the previous discussion, the vectors can be represented in column format as below.</p><p>$$
