If we orient it along z axis, the measured spin will either be +1 or -1.</p><p>$\sigma_z = \pm 1$. We can denote +1 as state $\ket{u}$ and -1 as $\ket{d}$.</p><p>Similarly $\sigma_x = \pm 1$, can be denoted by $\ket{r}$ and -1 as $\ket{l}$. And $\sigma_y = \pm 1$, can be denoted by $\ket{o}$ and -1 as $\ket{i}$.</p><p>If two states are orthogonal then these two states can be determined together. For example, if $\sigma_z$ was prepared to be in $\ket{u}$, for any subsequent measurements the probability that $\ket{d}$ is detected is 0. Thus, for binary spin, the state space is two dimensional. For now we can take $\ket{u}, \ket{d}$ as the basis vectors.</p><p>Then, the generic state $\ket{A} = \alpha_u \ket{u} + \alpha_d \ket{d}$. Where $\alpha_i = \braket{i|A}$.</p><p>The meaning of,</p><ul><li>$\alpha_u^\ast \alpha_u$: If the spin was prepared in $\ket{A}$ state, $\alpha_u^\ast \alpha_u$ is the probability that $\sigma_z = +1$.</li><li>$\alpha_d^\ast \alpha_d$: is the probability that $\sigma_z = -1$.</li></ul><p>Since probabilities must add to 1, $\alpha_u^\ast \alpha_u + \alpha_d^\ast \alpha_d = 1$. It is equivalent to saying that $\ket{A}$ is normalized, i.e., $\braket{A|A} = 1$.</p><p>General principle of quantum systems: the state of a system is represented by a unit (normalized) vector in a vector space of states. Moreover, the squared magnitudes of the components of the state-vector, <strong>along particular basis vectors</strong>, represent probabilities for various experimental outcomes.</p><h3 id=representing-ketr-and-ketl-using-above-basis-vectors>Representing $\ket{r}$ and $\ket{l}$ using above basis vectors<a href=#representing-ketr-and-ketl-using-above-basis-vectors class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>We know that if A initially prepares the state in $\ket{r}$, $\sigma_z = \pm 1$ with equal probability. Hence, $\alpha_u^\ast \alpha_u =\alpha_d^\ast \alpha_d = \frac{1}{2}$. One choice is to have $\alpha_u = \alpha_d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.</p><p>$\ket{r} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{u} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{d}$. (There are is still ambiguity, called phase ambiguity.)</p><p>To solve for $\ket{l}$ the above process repeats. But, in addition, $\braket{l|r} = 0$. One choice is $[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$. But it is not the only choice. Even for fixed choice for $\ket{r}$, you can multiply above choice by a phase factor ($z = e^{i\theta}$), and still satisfy the two constraints. Later, we will find out that no measurable quantity is sensitive to the overall phase-factor, and therefore we can ignore it when specifying states.</p><h3 id=representing-keti-and-keto-using-above-basis-vectors>Representing $\ket{i}$ and $\ket{o}$ using above basis vectors<a href=#representing-keti-and-keto-using-above-basis-vectors class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>To solve for $\ket{i}$ and $\ket{o}$, we need same conditions as we needed above. But we also need additional constrains. For example, if A prepares the state in $\ket{i}$,$\sigma_x = \pm1$, with equal probability. Also $\braket{i|o} = 0$.</p><p>The following solution solves for these constraints (up to phase-factor ambiguity).</p><p>$\ket{i} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{u} + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{d}$.</p><p>$\ket{o} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{u} - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{d}$.</p><p>With the previous discussion, the vectors can be represented in column format as below.</p><p>$$

We can take any direction $\hat{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$, orient the apparatus A along $\hat n$, activate A, and measure the component of the spin along $\hat n$.

But, as it turns out, most of the solutions for E, including all the complenumbers, have associated $\Psi_E$ which blows up as x approaches one or both infinities. So, we want the E, and associated $\Psi_E$ where $\Psi_E$ is normalizable.</p><h4 id=smallest-eigenvalue>Smallest eigenvalue<a href=#smallest-eigenvalue class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h4><p>Classical oscillator does not have negative energy. The reason for it is that it has square terms $x^2$ and $p^2$ in it. But, zero is the minimum energy, arrived when $x = p = 0$.</p><p>Quantum oscillator, has $X^2$ and $P^2$, both of which has non-negative eigenvalues. So the minimum energy has to be non-negative. (Because we have $P^2/2 + \omega^2/2 X^2$. A non-negative sum of positive semi-definite matrices is also positive semi-definite. I assume that argument would hold true for complex operators as well.) But, in QM, as per heisenberg&rsquo;s uncertainy principle, we can&rsquo;t set $X = P = 0$. The state associated with the lowest positive eigenvalue is known as ground state, and is denoted as $\Psi_0$.</p><p>There is a theorem which helps us find the eigenfunction associated with the smallest eigenvalue.</p><pre><code>The ground-state wave function for any potential has no zeros and it’s the only energy eigenstate that has no nodes.

$$
\begin{align*}
N (a^+\ket{n}) &= (a^+ N - (a^+ N - N^a+)) \ket{n} \\
&= n a^+ \ket{n} - [a^+, N]\ket{n} \\
&= n a^+ \ket{n} + a^+ \ket{n} \\
&= (n+1) a^+ \ket{n}
\end{align*}
$$</p><p>Thus, $a^+ \ket{n}$ is the eigenvector with next eigenvalue. i.e., $(a^+ \ket{n}) = \ket{n+1}$.</p><p>Similarly, $N a^- \ket{n} = (n-1) a^- \ket{n}$, and $a^-\ket{n} = \ket{n-1}$.</p><p>Because of these, $a^+$ is known as raising operator, and $a^-$ is known as lowering operator.</p><p>By the way, since $H = \omega \hbar (N + 1/2)$, lowering can&rsquo;t continue indefinitely, otherwise H might end up with negative eigenvalues. Thus, for the smallest eigenvector, call it $\ket{0}$, $a^- \ket{0} = 0$. This vector, solves the time-independent schrodinger&rsquo;s equation for $E_0 = \omega \hbar /2$.</p><p>$E_n = \omega \hbar (1/2, 3/2, 5/2, \dots)$.</p><h5 id=but-what-is-the-ground-state>But, what is the ground state?<a href=#but-what-is-the-ground-state class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h5><p>We can find the ground state by using the lowering operator on the $a^-$. $ \frac{i}{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} (P - i \omega \hbar X) \psi_0{x} = 0$.</p><p>$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{i}{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} (P - i \omega \hbar X) \psi_0{(x)} &= 0 \\
(P - i \omega \hbar X) \psi_0{(x)} &= 0 \\
-i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi_0{(x)}}{\partial x} - i \omega x \psi_0{(x)} &= 0 \\
\frac{\partial \psi_0{(x)}}{\partial x} = -\frac{\omega x}{\hbar} \psi_0{(x)}
\end{align*}
$$</p><p>This solution has equation $\psi_0{(x)} = e^{-\frac{\omega}{2 \hbar} x^2}$.</p><p>The next eigenvectors can be found by using $a^+$ operator on the ground state. Not doing the algebra here, but the solutions for the next two states are below.</p><p>$$
\begin{align*}
\psi_1(x) &= \frac{2 \omega x}{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} e^{-\frac{\omega}{2 \hbar} x^2} \\
\psi_2(x) &= \frac{\omega}{\pi \hbar} (-\hbar + 2 \omega x^2) e^{-\frac{\omega}{2 \hbar} x^2} \\

$$</p><p>It is easy to notice that for each step higher in the eigenstate, we have higher degree polynomial multiplied by the ground state. As the degree of the polynomial increases, the zeros of the statefunction, and nodes of the amplitudes increase. Thus, higher energy wave functions have higher frequency, implying higher momentum. Also, since the exponential goes to zero faster than the polynomial, the wave function are &ldquo;good&rdquo;, i.e., they go to zero towards the infinities.</p><p><img alt=image.png src=/notes/physics/theoretical_minimum/qm-notes/images/attachment:3fce27c0-2578-4ab1-8d39-7c3096802b26.png></p><p>Although, they approch zero towards infinities, they are not quite zero.
